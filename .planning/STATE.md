# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-18)

**Core value:** One deployable, multi-tenant MCP gateway that exposes the entire Microsoft Graph surface an organization needs — with tenant isolation, resilient Graph transport, and all four identity flows — so AI assistants can safely act on behalf of any user or app across any registered tenant.
**Current focus:** Phase 07 — agentic-tool-surface-discovery-default-mcp-resources-prompts

## Current Position

Phase: 07 (agentic-tool-surface-discovery-default-mcp-resources-prompts) — COMPLETE / HUMAN_NEEDED
Plan: 12 of 12
Status: Phase 07 code complete; external Claude.ai connector UX verification remains
Last activity: 2026-04-25 -- Phase 07 review fixes applied and gates passed

Progress: [██████████] 100% (8/8 phases)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v2 major rewrite (breaking changes OK) over evolution — documented in PROJECT.md
- Keep `openapi-zod-client` generator; do NOT wrap `@microsoft/msgraph-sdk` — SDK audit confirms our pipeline is the right shape for MCP
- All four identity flows concurrent (delegated, app-only, bearer pass-through, device code) — landed together in Phase 3 to avoid double-touching AuthManager
- Stack additions: Postgres (durable tenant registry, audit, delta tokens) + Redis (PKCE, token cache, rate limits) — both lazy/optional in stdio mode
- [Phase 07]: Tenant resource reads compare URI tenant id against getRequestTenant().id before any data read. — Mitigates tenant resource URI information disclosure for Plan 07-11.
- [Phase 07]: Endpoint schema resources validate aliases against discoveryCatalogSet, not the visible discovery-v1 meta-tool set. — Allows discovery tenants to inspect generated Graph/product schemas without exposing them in tools/list.
- [Phase 07]: Tenant resources are registered as concrete caller-tenant URIs; templates are limited to workload and endpoint schema families. — Prevents cross-tenant template enumeration while keeping resources/list discoverable for the caller tenant.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 7 added: agentic-tool-surface — discovery-mode default + MCP Resources (templated, per-tenant) + Prompts (10 canned workflows) + Notifications (tools/list, resources/list, resources/updated) + Logging capability + Completions + per-tenant memory (bookmarks, recipes, facts via Postgres + BM25 + optional pgvector) + admin API CRUD for memory + opt-in migration tool. Out of scope: Tasks/Elicitation/Sampling/Roots (no claude.ai client support yet).

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- Curated beta whitelist policy needs explicit sign-off in Phase 5 discuss-phase (per research SUMMARY gaps)
- Default essentials preset composition (~150 ops) needs explicit sign-off in Phase 5 discuss-phase
- MSAL pool eviction policy (LRU vs idle-timeout) needs decision during Phase 3 planning
- Phase 1 manual smokes pending operator sign-off: Docker HEALTHCHECK under real runtime, Compose+Caddy end-to-end, migrate-tokens round-trip with real OS keychain, kernel SIGTERM graceful shutdown, OTLP trace reaches collector

## Quick Tasks Completed

| ID | Slug | Date | Description | Status |
|----|------|------|-------------|--------|
| 260425-bxa | coolify-pull-policy | 2026-04-25 | `pull_policy: always` on mcp service — force Coolify to re-pull GHCR `:latest` on every redeploy. Resolves stale-image blocker that was masking the Redis subscriber-mode fixes (`ee08ae4`, `3027552`) and producing `rate_limit_error` on `tools/call`. | complete ✓ |
| 260425-e5x | mcp-401-www-authenticate | 2026-04-25 | Emit `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer …resource_metadata=…` on every 401 from the MCP path (RFC 9728 / MCP 2025-06-18). Fixes Claude.ai-style connector failure "Couldn't reach the MCP server". 5 emit sites + new helper + 12 unit tests. Commits `f1f67d3`, `2c3bce6`. | complete ✓ |
| 260425-gug | oauth-discovery-dcr | 2026-04-25 | RFC 8414 host-prefixed metadata routes + `registration_endpoint` in per-tenant auth-server metadata + `MS365_MCP_OAUTH_REDIRECT_HOSTS` env (default `claude.ai`) for DCR allowlist. Unblocks Claude.ai connector OAuth dance after /register stopped returning 400. Commit `a15eed8`. | complete ✓ |
